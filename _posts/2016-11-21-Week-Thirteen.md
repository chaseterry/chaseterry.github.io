## What did you do this past week?
I finished up Life. It wasn’t too bad all-in-all, I just wish I had spent more time on it earlier on as I was rushed to finish it up.

I heard about what it’s like to work at Spiceworks with another round of software engineers coming and talking about their company. Spiceworks seems like a pretty neat company.

I learned about abstract classes in C++; the real ones, not the pseudo-abstract AbstractCell I implemented in Life. 

I heard back from my dance TA audition and I got it! So next semester I’ll be teaching freshman and sophomores would to not awkwardly dance socially!

## What's in your way?
To be honest, not a whole lot. After a month and a half of craziness, I feel like things are started to settle down. The end is most definitely in sight and I no longer feel like this semester will drag on forever. I’m in a good place in school for the most part, and I’ve very glad to have Thanksgiving break almost upon us.

## What will you do next week?
Quite a bit for Mobile Computing, my android development class. I have my only test for the class on Tuesday and my plan is to finish up my final project during the break if possible so my last week of the semester isn’t terrible. We’ll see if I manage to get enough work done at home, which doesn’t seem likely.

## Class Impressions
Again, there’s not a whole lot new I’ve experience in OOP. There’s only a handful more classes left, and I don’t expect there to be too many surprises, but you never know.

## Tip of the Week
Since it’s getting around the time for summer internship offer deadlines, I recommend glassdoor.com as a source of information to help compare or decide offers.
