## What did you do this past week?
Continued to learn more fundamentals of OOP that I either never knew, went over my head eariler on, or completely forgot.
Tried for the life of me to get Docker working on my crouton linux and windows, and VM.
Started Collatz.
-lazy cache, eager, meta.
-Collatz todo list.
-white box/black box testing. unit test v acceptance testing.
-pre/post increment.
-ways of functions "communicating failures".
1)return value, 2) global variable, 3) paramter, 4) throw error
-Learned Professor Downing is apperently not imitidating as I thought


## What's in your way?
Docker is the worst.
I apperently cannot use technology anymore, or something has changed.

## What will you do next week?
Finish collatz.
learn more neat things about OOP.
Attempt to figure out why I cannot get a linux box on my machine.

## Tip of the Week
