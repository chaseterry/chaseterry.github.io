## What did you do this past week?
Continued to learn more fundamentals of OOP that I either never knew, went over my head earlier on, or completely forgot.
I have a Chromebook and have a version of precise Linux which is called crouton. I tried for the life of me to get Docker working on my crouton linux and windows laptop, but I couldn't get docker to run the Hello World image. I tried and failed to get a Linux VM to work on my Windows laptop with VirtualBox and VMWare. I ended up giving up with docker and just decided to work on the project itself.
Started Collatz.
-lazy cache, eager, meta.
-Collatz todo list.
-white box/black box testing. unit test v acceptance testing.
-pre/post increment.
-ways of functions "communicating failures".
1)return value, 2) global variable, 3) parameter, 4) throw error
-Learned Professor Downing is apparently not intimidating as I thought


## What's in your way?
Docker is the worst.
I apparently cannot use technology anymore, or something has changed.

## What will you do next week?
Finish collatz.
learn more neat things about OOP.
Attempt to figure out why I cannot get a linux box on my machine.

## Tip of the Week
Spritz, Spreed
