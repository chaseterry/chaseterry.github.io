## What did you do this past week?
AllOf.
lambda.

constructors.
class definements.
Autoconversions, frienship.

## What's in your way?
interviews?
// There seems to be a similar theme in all of my “What’s in your way?” posts: time. There’s just not enough hours in the day for everything I’m supposed to do, and everything I’d like to do. Not sure how to remedy this, because classes are important, interviews are important, sleep is very important, and keeping sane with having fun from time to time is also important.

## What will you do next week?
Test, android projects
Next week I will be starting the new project, whatever that may be. I have my partner lined up and I’m ready to go. I will also be starting the first wave of interviews for a summer internship. I’m excited for the possibility for my summer.

## Class Impressions
