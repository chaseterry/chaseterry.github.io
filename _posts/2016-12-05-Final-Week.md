## Final Reflection
It’s finally here, the end of the semester. I can’t say this has been my favorite semester, but it hasn’t been bad. Overall I’d say I’ve enjoyed Object Oriented Programming. I have been told every semester since coming to UT to take a Downing class, and I can see why; it’s a very unique experience. I’ve never had a professor try to engage the class through direct and aimed question asking, or have lectures consist mainly of code. However, I probably wouldn’t name this class Object Oriented Programming. Downing does teach us some OOP, but I feel like the majority of the class is learning things specific to C++, but not necessarily about OOP. I came into the class expecting to learn Object-Oriented theory, best practices, and design. I’ve learned some of this from the class, but overwhelmingly more about C++. I wanted to learn C++ at some point, so it’s been very helpful to learn the foundation of the language and a lot of best practices for it. I also really enjoyed that this class forced me to use tools of the trade. I’ve used git before, and some Docker, but that’s about it. I see the merits of continuous integration, makefiles, and a myriad of other software development tools. It was interesting to hear from alumni about their experiences in industry, and it has made me consider applying to companies I probably wouldn’t have normally. Overall, it’s been an interesting class.

## Final Tip
If you’re feeling like not being productive what-so-ever over the break, but want to fool yourself that you’re still learning, check out the game Screeps. I recently stumbled upon this gem of a game, and I’d love nothing more than to have other programmers to talk and strategize with. It is a purely programmer’s game. The essential idea behind the game is that the player programs an AI in JavaScript for units (called creeps) to grow, build, and defend your infrastructure against other players. It has the potential to get widely complex as you try out different strategies, systems, and goals. I’m excited to spend a huge chunk of my winter break on this game.
