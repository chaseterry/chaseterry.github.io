title: Week Five

## What did you do this past week?
This past week in OOP I learned more software contracts between algorithms and containers, and about iterators both in Java and C++. 
I also listed to another industry speaker in class, Alexander Menzies from JPL. 
Outside of class, I’m currently writing this blog post in San Francisco for a tech conference, and really enjoying it.

## What's in your way?
There seems to be a similar theme in all of my “What’s in your way?” posts: time. There’s just not enough hours in the day for everything I’m supposed to do, and everything I’d like to do. Not sure how to remedy this, because classes are important, interviews are important, sleep is very important and keeping sane with having fun from time to time is also important.

## What will you do next week?
Next week I will be starting the new project, whatever that may be. I have my partner lined up and I’m ready to go. I will also be starting the first wave of interviews for a summer internship. I’m excited for the possibility for my summer.

## Class Impressions
I’m still very new to C++ so I was somewhat lost for a decent portion of class this week, but I’m understand the concepts and catching up on the syntax and nature of the language. I like the focus on very specific concepts, such as why compile-time errors are far superior to runtime or logic errors. The example in class being the sort() method in both Java and C++. On a linked list in Java, sort is absolutely terribly slow. on a list in C++, it doesn’t compile.
I thought bringing in people in industry to come pitch their company would be boring, but it’s the opposite. It’s really great to hear from passionate senior engineers about their jobs and companies, and all the cool projects they’re working on. It’s making me consider companies I would otherwise not hear of or consider applying to.

## Pick of the Week
If you just couldn’t get enough of assembly in 429, you should check out (Human Resource Machine)[http://store.steampowered.com/app/375820/]. It’s a very neat game that abstracts away the components of the very low level instructions of assembly into a worker who grabs little tiles with data on them(an input stream or file), arranges them on the floor(the stack), does computation and logic on the tiles, and sends them to the outbox(output). It’s really fun, a good refresher on assembly and programming low level solutions to problems that are trivial in high level languages. There’s also a heavy dose of sarcasm, poignant views on the future of AI and automation, and a decent about of dark humor. I highly recommend it!
