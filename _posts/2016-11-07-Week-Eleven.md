## What did you do this past week?
I learned about move constructors! It's basically a thief that steals everything and leaves you to die with nothing. 

I also learned about static in C++. There are local static, global static, and class static variables. They all have interesting behavior I wouldn't exactly have expected, but it makes sense. 

I finished project Darwin with my partner. We made a pretty great "Best" creature that ended up with 47/50 of itself at the end of the 1000 turns.

I auditioned to be a dance TA! 

## What's in your way?
School has gotten very stressful lately. And by lately I mean over the last month, and probably for the next month until the semester ends. I also have one more job interview this weekend and then they should be over.

## What will you do next week?
For OOP I will start on Life, and hopefully finish it if I can before this weekend. I started Darwin a week late, and don't want to do that again. 

I still have the mid-project deliverable for my Mobile Computing class due this week. I will unfortunately not be flying to New York for the final round of a scholarship.

## Class Impressions
Life feels like a bit of a rehash of Darwin. But Conway's Game of Life is still pretty cool. I’ve never implemented it, but I’ve always enjoyed playing around with it. It seems relatively straightforward, but I’ve never see the Fredkin type of cell before. I hope this project doesn’t take up too much time because this week is a bit stressful.
