## What did you do this past week?
This week I learned from my mistakes of starting Collatz late and started with my pair programmer on the Netflix project on Monday. On Wednesday I learned much more about Bloomberg. I originally wrote Bloomberg off as just another "techy" finance company, but Bloomberg seems like a fantastic company that truly cares about making a positive impact. My goal after graduation has been to go into an industry or company that cares and strives to make a positive impact on their employees, customers, or the world. Currently looking into healthcare tech firms as that seems like the current best way to have a positive effect. Additionally on Friday I learned more basics about C/C++ that I had somewhat used before but never knew the format definitions of them, including arrays, lists, and iterators.
Unrelated to the class, I made it onto Texas Crew! Officially signed onto the team this weekend.

## What's in your way?
Networking, career fairs, and interviews. While not really negative or hindrance to me, these take up quite a bit of time. I’m excited for the possibilities for the summer, but these events take it out of me. Networking, career fairs, and interviews are exhausting. 

## What will you do next week?
I will be finishing up Netflix, and going to several networking events, two career fairs, and hopefully as many interviews as I can land. I will also be flying out to San Francisco this Friday for Out for Undergrad in Technology Conference.

## Class Impressions
I am really enjoying this class. It’s a fusion of practice technologies and skills for industry and learning the basics and importance of C++ or other object-oriented languages. The projects are based in practical problems and honestly fun to code. It was also nice to hear from a software engineering veteran in class.

## Tip of the Week
To keep you (and hopefully your pair programming partner) in good spirits during long coding sessions, check out [fun linux commands](http://www.tecmint.com/20-funny-commands-of-linux-or-linux-is-fun-in-terminal/) for a series of entertaining, wacky, or otherwise fun linux commands that have no practice uses, but are amusing. One of my favorites is “sl”, which is short for Steam Locomotive. You might have stumbled onto it as it is installed on all of the lab machines and happens whenever you type in “sl” or “LS”.
