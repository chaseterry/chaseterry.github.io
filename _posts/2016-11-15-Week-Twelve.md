## What did you do this past week?
I learned about Life. It seems similar relatively similar to Darwin, but we do have to implement the abstract and virtual bits, so that’s trickier.

I also learned (more) about method overriding/method refinement, how descendant classes deal with overloaded methods, and how virtual methods work.

I got a second round audition to be a dance TA and it went really well! So hopefully next semester I’ll be doing that on top of my other classes.

## What's in your way?
School continues to be stressful. We’re getting to the end of the semester and that means exams, projects, and homeworks have been and will continue to be throw at us constantly. I just need to make it to Thanksgiving break and everything will be fine. 

Whether it’s unfortunate or fortunate, I have gotten even more interviews, which means more stress! This seems to be pretty late in the interview season, but I should keep my options open. On top of this, offer deadlines are coming up, so I’ll have to pick what I’ll be doing over the summer soon.


## What will you do next week?
I will finish up project Life, while clinging onto my own life with everything going on at the moment, and hopefully finish it well in advance of the Thursday deadline. I didn’t take my own advice, and have started on it somewhat late, and not worked on it as diligently as I ought to, so I have to spend a significant amount of time working on Life this week.
I have two tests and a two projects due in the next week and the tiny week of Thanksgiving, so I’ll be largely working on those as well.


## Class Impressions
I don’t particularly have any new ideas to talked about OOP. This week has been straightforward in learning the project, learning about C++, and working on the project.


## Tip of the Week
If you need a break from schoolwork, and want to waste your time and hard-earned money, I recommend checking out www.kickstarter.com (specifally the technology page) for a series of neat but ultimately useless tech gadgets for which you’ll have to wait up to five years to recieve from the time you paid for it! I really like Kickstarter, but I’ve been burned a couple of times on products. In the end, it’s a cool website to look at neat new tech ideas people have come up with.
