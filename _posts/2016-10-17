## What did you do this past week?
I learned about C++ memory management, memory management in general. Through this, I learned about heaps, why theyâ€™re good, and how to implement a simple one.

I started and finished my third Object-Oriented Programming, second partner project. 

I also have not been in class because of interviews. As Downing has said, the most important thing to prepare for a future career in computer science is getting internships. So that's what I've been trying to accomplish. It's not super fun, but necessary. Multiple flights, stressful interviews, missing classes, but it's not all bad to be flown to a new city and getting a few hours to just explore.

## What's in your way?
This may be my fourth, fifth, or even sixth week in a row complaining about internship interviews, but it's mostly consumed my life so I feel like it's a valid complaint.

## What will you do next week?
I will try to go to as many Object-Oriented Programming classes as my interview season allows, and catch up on all my schoolwork which has fallen by the wayside due to these interviews I don't stop talking about.

## Class Impressions
I was a bit disappointed in the most recent project. It was by far the easiest project in this class as of yet. It should have taken my partner and I less than 2 or 3 hours, but we had a silly bug that took a while to find. It was implementing a simple heap, which we have been asked to do before. I understand using the heap is important for Object-Oriented Programming, but implementing one feels much more system level than Object-Oriented.
