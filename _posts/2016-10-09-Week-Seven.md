## What did you do this past week?
I learned far too much than I ever expected to learn about const. const int, const int*, int* const, and of course const int* const. I feel like I mostly understand them now, but syntactically it feels silly to have const int* const.

Additionally, I had my first Object-Oriented Programming exam. I had expected something a bit different, but I don't think it was a negative thing. I had expected some more conceptual questions, similar to quiz questions in class, but I was mostly happy with my solutions to the programming questions. I've never truly had an all programming test, so we'll see how it turned out when it's graded.

## What's in your way?
Flying. I'm flying to four cities (as of now, maybe more), over the next three weeks for final round internship interviews. It's incredibly exciting, and I imagine incredibly tiring. It's going to be around 2 days of just being in the air. I'm not fond of airplanes, but I'm fond of well paying internships, so it's worth it. Hopefully one or more of them pan out. 

## What will you do next week?
I will start the next OOP project! I will continue to interview! I will continue to work on other school assignments, and continue to work at my job, and continue keep my sanity under the ever amounting stress. But everything is positive at the moment, so I suppose I shouldn't complain.

## Class Impressions
My overall class impressions have remained about the same for this week. It's neat to learn formally about all of the OO languages concepts and optimization for best coding practice. I think the exam went well for the most part. It was a bit stressful with the timer counting down in the upper right corner, but I made it through the exam.

## Pick of the Week
Try out an online service to learn more programming languages, such as Lynda.com or TeamTreeHouse.com. I've found they're very helpful for quickly picking up the basics of new languages, or refining skills in languages you thought you knew. It's much faster and more pleasant than reading a large language tutorial book or reference.
